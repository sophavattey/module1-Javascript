# User Profile - CRUD Application

created by: Nou Sophavattey

## Project Overview
User Profile built with vanilla JavaScript that demonstrates complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The application allows users to manage personal profiles with avatar images, contact information, and company details.

## Technical Implementation
Modern JavaScript Concepts Used:
- ES6 Modules - Modular code architecture with import/export
- Async/Await - Asynchronous operations for API calls and file handling
- Spread Operator (...) - Immutable state management and object copying
- Fetch API - HTTP requests to external APIs
- localStorage - Browser storage for data persistence
- Arrow Functions - Modern function syntax throughout
- Promises - File upload handling with FileReader API

## Dummy API

- user api: https://randomuser.me/api/
- placeholder api = https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
